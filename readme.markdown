# IIT (Inherited Initial Toolkit)

As the name suggested, I did not creat this. All credits goes to people originally created and shared thier repositories on github.

All repositories I have inspired and/or based on are listed in [/inherited/](https://github.com/studiomohawk/IIT/tree/master/inherited) and those who created are also listed on [humans.txt](https://github.com/studiomohawk/IIT/blob/master/humans.txt)  
I thank you all for your great creations.

IIT is my version of boilerplate/bootstrap. This repo will always be beta since I will constantly tweak.  
As Kirby Ferguson of [Everthing is a Remix](http://www.everythingisaremix.info/) brilliantly put it:  
"Copy, transform and combine. It’s who we are, it’s how we live, and of course, it’s how we create. Our new ideas evolve from the old ones."
